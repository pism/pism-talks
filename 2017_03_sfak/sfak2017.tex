  \note[item]{ When less solar energy is received earth enters into an ice age; when earth begins to receive more solar energy it comes out of the ice age. The amount of solar energy and the resulting changes to temperature this has can be worked out and it amounts to around 5 degrees C.}
  \note[item]{The additional rise and fall in temperatures beyond the 5 degrees C range can only be explained by the effects of CO2 concentration in the atmosphere due to various feedback or forcing mechanisms.}
  \note[item]{As the earth's temperature begins to drop feedback occur that reduce the amount of CO2 being produced and atmospheric concentrations begin to fall.}
  \note[item]{At the end of an ice age as more solar energy is received and again as temperatures begin to rise; feedbacks begin to produce more CO2 increasing CO2 concentrations.}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item The existence of the greenhouse effect was argued for by Joseph Fourier in 1824.
  \item The argument and the evidence were further strengthened by Claude Pouillet in 1827 and 1838 
  \item and reasoned from experimental observations by John Tyndall in 1859, who measured the radiative properties of specific greenhouse gases.
  \item The effect was more fully quantified by Svante Arrhenius in 1896, who made the first quantitative prediction of global warming due to a hypothetical doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide
