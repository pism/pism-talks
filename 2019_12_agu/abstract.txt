Sensitivity of frontal melt to surface meltwater runoff routing

Frontal melt at marine terminating glaciers are strongly controlled by ocean thermal forcing and subglacial discharge. Subglacial discharge is difficult to observe directly and thus its spatial and temporal variability is commonly estimated from surface meltwater runoff derived from regional climate models. Here we investigate the sensitivity of frontal melt rates to surface meltwater runoff. Comprehensive basal hydrology models that route water subglacially to the ice margin are computationally extremely expensive and are thus not a viable solution on time scales larger than a decade. We have developed a new computationally efficient routing model which we compare to the comprehensive model as well as to the approaches used by the Ice Sheet Modeling Intercomparison for CMIP6 (ISMIP6) community effort.
