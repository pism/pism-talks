The Parallel Ice Sheet Model (PISM)

The Parallel Ice Sheet Model (PISM) is a fully-parallel, open-source ice sheet model capable of high-resolution simulations of glaciers and ice sheets over time scales from years to millions of years. While PISM's history dates back to the late 1990's, PISM in its current form emerged around 2003 and became open-source in 2006. The development was led by mathematician Ed Bueler and math graduate student Jed Brown, as well as glaciologist Craig Lingle, and included exact solutions for verification. Today, PISM is one of the main workhorses in computational glaciology, used around the world by many groups. Strengths include it's parallel core, scalability, well-documented source code and an API that allows for easy extension and coupling to other models.
