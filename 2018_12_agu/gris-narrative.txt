Many of us are wondering how Greenland will look like in the future and how much it's going to contribute to sea-level. For the past two decades, glaciologists have been using ice sheet models in an attempt to answer these questions.

Slide 3

A key ingredient in accurately projecting sea-level rise with an ice sheet model is model's the ability to reproduce present day. It's like making a  weather forecast: to predict tomorrow, you need to know the weather today. Unfortunately, previous efforts have struggled with reproducing the velocity field, presenting a major roadblock. Here is a comparison of the observed surface speeds and a model realization using the best data sets available in 2013. As you can see, the model fails to capture the fast outlet glacier flow shown in purple and red colors.

Slide 4

Thanks to NASA's Operation IceBridge, this has changed. Accurate ice thickness now enables models to capture the flow patterns in outlet glaciers with high fidelity. Here is model realization using the BedMachine ice thickness data set that has became available in 2014.

Slide 5

Now, for the first time we can do an assessment of Greenland's contribution to sea-level with a model that resolves outlet glacier flow. The idea of this project is to provide something like a baseline for the ongoing Ice Sheet Model Intercomparison Project for CMIP6. First ISMPI6 results are expected sometime next year.

Slide 6

Here are the results. In a thousand years, Greenland will look different than today. Following an RCP 2.6 scenario, the margin will retreat almost everywhere except in south-east where accumulation rates are high. However, the ice sheet will resemble today's configuration with many outlet glaciers. Following the RCP 4.5 trajectory leads to a much reduced ice sheet where most outlet glaciers have become land terminating. And for RCP 8.5, the ice sheet is gone. [Pause] Well, the session is about quantifying and decreasing Uncertainty in Projections of Future Sea Level Change. Of course I don't believe that estimating sea-level should be done without an uncertainty quantification. In fact, the uncertainty quantification is an integral aspect of this study. Let me walk you through it.

Slide 7

We select eleven model parameters from the four broad categories: Climate, surface processes, ice dynamics, and ice/ocean interaction. The climate, for example, inludes the choice of GCM to calculate surface temperature increase for a given RCP scenario. Ice dynamics includes basal sliding, and the ocean category calving and frontal melt. For each of the eleven parameters, we prescribe an appropriate distribution, for example a truncated normal distribution for the exponent of the sliding law. We then draw 500 samples using a Latin Hypercube Sampling method. Finally, for each of the three RCP scenarios we run 500 simulations, burning 2M CPU hours over the course of a year.

Slide 8

The result is a likelihood map of Greenland in a thousand year: the likelihood of a pixel being ice covered. White colors indicate that at least 84 percent of the ensemble members have ice in a given location, while blue-ish colors indicate smaller likelihoods.

Slide 9

How will we get there? One of the eleven parameters is the choice of GCM that produces the temperature forcing. I found 4 GCM realizations in the CMIP5 archive that were carried out until 2300, after which we extrapolated.
The upper panel shows the temperature anomalies projected by the GCMs. Shown are the ensemble minimum and maximums. The thick solid line is a control (not the median) that we use for inter-scenario comparison. As you can see, there is significant spread among the four GCM realizations, which then of course turns into large variability in projected sea-level contribution. The lower panel shows the projected contribution to sea-level. Here the shaded area shows the 84th and 16th percentiles of the ensemble. 67 % of the ensemble members lose >90 % and 58 % of ensemble members lose >99 % of initial ice volume.

Just before AGU last year, Mark Fahnestock, Martin Truffer, and myself looked at this figure. Wouldn't it be nice to know which parameter contributes the most to the uncertainty in mass loss? Fortunatly I later attended a talk by Andrew Davies at the AGU in New Orleans and learned that Sobel Indices can exactly do that. Soon after AGU Doug Brinkerhoff then perfomed the analysis for us.

Slide 10

A key finding of the Sobel analysis is that uncertainties vary with time and across RCP scenarios. Much to our surprise uncertainties in prescribing calving and frontal melt do not contribute significanlty to uncertainties in mass loss. Uncertainties in basal motion (i.e. the exponent in the sliding law)  matter in the next 200 years and then decline for RCPs 2.6 and 4.5 but for 8.5. Uncertainties due to climate forcing grow over time (RCP 8.5 in particular), and so do surface processes. A caveat is that there could be interactions between sliding and ocean forcing that are not captured by the Sobel analysis.

Slide 11

The past two decades have seen an increase in the contribution of outlet glaciers to mass loss. And at present, ice discharge contributes about 40% the increase in mass loss. How much will outlet glaciers contribute  in the future? Our Greenland-wide simulations allow us to address this question. [Start movie] The left plot shows the contribution of ice discharge to mass loss on the 16th and 84th percentile level. The right figure shows north-west Greenland between Sverdrup Glacier and Rink Isbrae. Following the RCP 4.5 scenario, outlet glaciers will retreat significantly over the next four hundred years, however, their relative contribution to mass loss will decrease. Why? We illustrate this with a flowline plot along Upernavik Isstrom South.

Slide 12

Upernaik Isstrom shows a relatively gradual retreat, with short episodes when the glacier speeds up after it loses contact with a bedrock high. While the glacier speeds ups, the flux (product of ice thickness and horizontally-averaged velocities) overall decreases.

Slide 13
In summary we find that Greenland could very well disappear within a millennium if we continue on the RCP 8.5 path. Rates can reach 1cm SLR per year.
Of course this study is not a final answer, it is rather the beginning of a new era in ice sheet modeling.
