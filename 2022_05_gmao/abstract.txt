A reanalysis of the Greenland Ice Sheet

Accurate predictions of the ice sheets' future contribution to sea-level require that models yield simulations that fit observations within observational uncertainty, yet current ice sheet hindcasts show poor agreement with observations. While reanalyses created by blending observations with numerical models using data assimilation techniques have been widely-available for decades, for both the atmosphere (e.g., ERA, MERRA-2) and the ocean (e.g., ECCO), similar products for the ice sheets currently do not exist. Here we will assimilate surface elevation and velocity observations with the Parallel Ice Sheet Model PISM to create a reanalysis of the Greenland Ice Sheet for 1980-2020 (RAGIS-40) based on Ensemble Kalman Filtering/Smoothing. This NASA-funded project is in the early phase of gathering data sets and setting up the assimilation framework, and we hope for a stimulating discussion with NASA's Global Modeling and Assimilation Office.
